# Ed Shazimans Website

[https://edshaziman.com/](https://edshaziman.com/)

_This project is my personal website built using React, SASS, CSS, and HTML5._
_Contains my personal portfolio projects and more info about me._

_I've avoided using CSS frameworks for this project to show my vanilla CSS and SASS understanding._
_I think a person who knows vanilla CSS can understand any CSS framework without having any difficulties_
